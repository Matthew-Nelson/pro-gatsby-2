A static query can be used anywhere but it does not accept variables or parameters of any kind. Also, iut cannot use the context that we just set.

Page query must be used on pages that have been registered.

I think I may have an error within my archive...I am having to edit that url that we are passing to the link whereas scott didnt have to do that. He simply added it in and it was taken care of. what do?
