So there was an issue with the <></> fragment and i just replaced it with a div to get rid of the weirdness that I was seeing. Definitely dont understand what the deal was with that but I think the styling stuff is very intuitive. I wonder how nesting styled componenets within children components will work...Like a child element and a parent element. Lets give it a shot.

So I think the children elements are loaded in later on? idk...but it looks like if the same specificity is defined, then the children will take priority. which is awesome.
