Okay so essentially, we are passing in a variable with the name 'slug' (could be anything) into our contexrt on gatsby node. We can then call it within our page that we create by querying for it in our graphql query in the postLayout template. Essentially, we are saying, okay, to create a page with this template, take the md file with a matching slug and give us back the remarked document. Then we build our page from that within this template.
