Thus far, we only have a dev view and we need to actually build the site so it is static html, css, and js.

There may be some errors within our terminal readout. If that is the case, just clear the cache with a 'gatsby clean' and then try again. Also consider adding some default prop types if any of our props are pathnames. Scott said that this can throw off our build but I didnt get the same errors that he was getting when he was building.

We get a built 'public' folder.
